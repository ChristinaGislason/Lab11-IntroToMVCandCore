# Lab11-IntroToMVCandCore
My First MVC App

## Challenge

Create my first ASP.NET Core MVC web application.
This web app will allow a user to put in a span of 2 different years, and a list of all the winners will be returned.

The MVC Web Application contains the following:

* Adding MVC Middleware and including template routing. 
* 1 controller. The home controller, with 3 actions (2 Index, and 1 Results). Upon posting back to the server, Results action is called to redirect to the results view.
* Views to generate the home page and search results.
* A form tag accepts user input. Tag Helpers that help redirect user from results page to the Home page. 
* Includes HTML/CSS to modify visuals. Enable use of Static Files on the website and create a style sheet to incorporate.
* A model class contains the properties(that are the headers of the csv file).
